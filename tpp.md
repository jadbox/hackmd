*A better model for monetizing online content anywhere on the Internet using token ownership.*

## What's this about?


Token permission pages allow creators to display their content only to consumers who hold a sufficient balance of the creator‚Äôs personal token.  

In contrast to the traditional content selling models (where consumers pay creators with a cash or crypto transaction), token permission pages simply require consumers to hold some minimum quantity of the creators personal token.  This incentivizes long term holding of personal tokens, which creates an investor-investee relationship between creators and consumers. 

Token permissioning can be applied to any webpage, breaking creators free of walled garden platforms like Patreon and OnlyFans.

By just requiring token ownership for access, it reduces gas costs and requires transaction-free minimal effort on the user to access web content. 

**How it works:**

The Token Permissioned Pages platform [TPP] is a special reverse proxy that acts like an authorization gateway that gates by a minimum token balance to gain access to Internet content (hosted anywhere). The TPP platform has fully built-in support for many types of crypto wallets for verifying token ownership.

## ‚ö° Use-cases

* Any content meant for only a token community to have access
  * newsletters
  * blog
  * splash page
  * unlisted youtube video links
  * unlisted podcasts


## üëØ Compatibility

### Tokens
* Any [ERC-20](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained) token is supported
* ERC-721 is not supported (yet!)

### Supported user wallets
*For verifying with the user's web3 wallet to validate token access to source link content*
* Metamask
* Wallet Connect
* Roll
* Coinbase wallet
### Link Addresses
* Currently both the source url and TPP shared link are limtied to HTTP protocol only. We're in the process of investigating future HTTPS support.
* IPFS links are only supported via an [IPFS HTTP gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ipfs-gateway/browsing-ipfs/). Native IPFS support is on the roadmap.
* DAT links are also currently unsupported

## üìñ Terminology

* *Source URL* is the URL you provide TPP to secretly tunnel public traffic to if the user has enough token balance
* *Proxy URL* the public TPP link that serves content from the *source url*.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Limitations and notes
* **Important**: ensure your source URL is blocked from search engines via a robots.txt or *noindex* metatag (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710?hl=en)
* User sessions and cookies from the origin will not work that well with the TPP proxy. It's recommended to stick with static pages/spa that do not rely on user sessions.

## üèÉ Getting Started: generate a link

Use the below link and replace the attributes: **url**, **token** (address), and (min) **balance** to what you need. The resulting json will have url and social fields for the proxy links.

### Example link request:

http://gen.link.collab.land/gen?url=GOOGLE.COM&token=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f&balance=3

### Response:

The response will be a json with two keys. The "url" key will be the direct link that can be sent to an audience directly to use. The "social" key is a special url that works better for posted the link on Twitter on social platforms, but this link requires an extra redirect for the user to visit the link.

**Schema:**
```js
{"url": "http://xxx", "social": "https://xxx"}
```

**Example response:**
```js
{
"url":"http://50334b501623351369115d3c56ed95.4c3e2af38f9dba84dfab4f4e10d1112399e37b3a1692300345db7a6fc73.1afbf0b0d63650b06916433cd282a.705c39d52fa241f0302fd785cdb2d.c9ff7a1fad04c.link.collab.land/",
"social":"http://50334b501623351369115d3c56ed95.4c3e2af38f9dba84dfab4f4e10d1112399e37b3a1692300345db7a6fc73.1afbf0b0d63650b06916433cd282a.705c39d52fa241f0302fd785cdb2d.c9ff7a1fad04c.link.collab.land/tppsocial/"
}
```
